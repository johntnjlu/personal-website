    ai prompts for web facing component:
        - can I get a project template for a static, modern looking personal website?
        - <div class="social-links">
            <a href="#" title="LinkedIn">💼</a>
            <a href="#" title="GitHub">🔗</a>
            <a href="#" title="Twitter">🐦</a>
            <a href="#" title="Dribbble">🎨</a>
        </div>

        - can you make this more professional by only including linkedin and github with either small logos or just text
        - can you add an email with an icon as well like previously
        - Can you remove the footer and put the contact information into a separate block instead labeled contact links, reach me at, or something similarly professional
